  <h1>My First Trip to the One and Only Disney World</h1>
  <p>These photos tell the story of a trip to Disney World!
    These photos go from the plane ride to Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom,
    a stay at the resort, and the M&M store! Each photo shares a different
    aspect of Disney and they also challenge me in alt text, some being tough
    to describe.
