      <p> 7 Perspectives On Love </p>
    <p>Everyone has their own perspective on love and everyone’s love story looks different or will look different in their life. Our idea of what love is can come from the way we were raised, the role models we had or even now the movies we watch and music we listen to.
This list provides you with the 7 most memorable perspectives on love that I can think of using words, music, movies, books, and more. (I’ll try not to spoil too much.)

    <h2>John 3:16</h2>
    <p><a href="#">Bible</a></p>
    <p>“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”
-Jesus
This Bible verse is the ultimate definition of love. Jesus loved us so much that he was willing to die on a cross for us and save us from our sins. Because of him, we now have the opportunity to have a personal relationship with God and have our sins forgiven. What better love is there than this?

    <h2>The Lovely Bones</h2>
    <p>By: Alice Sebold</p>
    <p><a href="#">Get book name of book shop.org</a></p>
    <p> The Lovely Bones is one of the saddest movies/books I’ve ever read,
      but I love it. In this movie, you truly see the love of a family. Sometimes
      people love you so much that they will do anything for you or they love you so much that they shut down and
      shut the world out. This movie makes me think about the fact that we sometimes hang on to things even when we know there’s
      something better waiting for us ahead.

    <h2>My Song</h2>
    <p> By: H.E.R </p>
    <p> To me, this song represents love. I’m convinced that I will walk down the aisle to this song.
      The lyrics are so calming and soft and talk about running away with someone when no else understands you.
      The day I find someone I want to run away with will be the day I know I’ve found my lifelong  best friend.

    <h2>The Notebook</h2>
    <p>By: Nick Cassavetes</p>
    <p> The movie reminds me that sometimes love leaves but it can return and sometimes when we love something we have to let it go.
      The story of this couple is beautiful and this move truly kept me on my toes.
      The end shows what it looks like to be in love for the long haul.

    <h2>“I can’t go to bed until you make it home.”</h2>
    <p> -Mom </p>
    <p> I never understood why my mom said things to me like this.
       The older I get the more I realize that it’s because she loves me and wants nothing more than to protect me no matter how old I get.

    <h2>Love Is Blind</h2>
    <p>Now some may say this is desperate love and to some degree I can’t argue with that.
       I think the show shows what it looks like to be willing to do almost anything for love.
       Marrying a stranger is not something I think I could ever do but cheers to those who do and are successful with it.

    <h2>She’s Gotta Have It </h2>
      <p>By: Spike Lee</p>
    <p> I love this show and it really flips the script on us. Nola Darling is a woman of her own and is playing the game that many men play.
      She is truly having her cake and eating it too until she isn’t.
       Nola deals all the cards here and I truly think that there can be many different perspectives on this woman's life.
       She juggles several different relationships and is unapologetic about it. In the end, is she truly happy though?
